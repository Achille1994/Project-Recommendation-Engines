# Project Recommendation-Engines

Introduction
For this project I will analyze the interactions that users have with articles on the IBM Watson Studio platform, and make recommendations to them about new articles you think they will like. Below you can see an example of what the dashboard could look like displaying articles on the IBM Watson Platform.

In order to determine which articles to show to each user, I will be performing a study of the data available on the IBM Watson Studio platform

### Project motivation

In the IBM Watson Studio, there is a large collaborative community ecosystem of articles, datasets, notebooks, and other A.I. and ML. assets. Users of the system interact with all of this. Within this scope, we created this recommendation system project to enhance the user experience and connect them with assets. This personalizes the experience for each user.

By following the table of contents, I will build out a number of different methods for making recommendations that can be used for different situations. 
## Table of Contents

I. [Exploratory Data Analysis](#Exploratory-Data-Analysis)<br>
II. [Rank Based Recommendations](#Rank)<br>
III. [User-User Based Collaborative Filtering](#User-User)<br>
IV. [Matrix Factorization](#Matrix-Fact)<br>
V. [Extras & Concluding](#conclusions)
